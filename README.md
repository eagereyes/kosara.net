## Kosara.net paper redirecter

This repo serves the kosara.net website from github pages. It mostly exists to redirect the old publications pages from kosara.net to the new ones on eagereyes.org, and to host the paper PDFs at the old URLs.

The makeRedirects script creates the redirects from the papers.json file living elsewhere. It's all extremely simple and really of no interest to anybody else.
